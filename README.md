Analyzing more than 525 000 items and finding unique items by using (finding support, confidence and lift) I was able to identify in each country like( UK, France, Germany) best selling items and most selling items. 
I had to work with different dataset and each time create new dataset to work with for different country. 
In the end I was sorting dataset by support and confidence and using (box chart, pier chart) for visualizations of my results. 
This way I was able to identify best selling items and best selling items with them.

- Analyzing more than 525 000 items and finding unique items by using (support, confidence, and lift) I was able to identify in each country ( UK, France, and Germany) best-selling items and second best-selling items. 
- I had to work with different datasets and each time create a new dataset to work with for different countries. 
- In the end, I was sorting the dataset by support and confidence and used (a box chart, and pier chart) for visualizations of my results. 
- This way I was able to identify best-selling items and best-selling items with them.
